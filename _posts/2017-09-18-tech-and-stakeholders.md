title: Reporting Up - From Nerdspeak to Executive Reports
While still early in my adult life, and inherently a geek at heart, I've learned some valuable lessons about reporting up in the workplace. While I find code, data, and systems exhilarating, a good amount of people do not, and might even be adverse to understanding the ins-and-outs of what we do as technology and data professionals. To avoid some of your favorite comebacks like "What the hell are you talking about?" or "English please?" or the best one "Look, I don't care how it works...", check out some of these tips that can help you to report up.

## Know Your Audience

As a current IT professional, I get to work around the business with almost every department, all with differing degrees of knowledge on the program. Now that I've been working with the same teams for a few years, I am able to tailor my reporting to the person who I'm presenting to. If my Director wants to know how an integration is going or how data will flow into a specific system, I know I can get a little more granular without making her head explode. If I'm working with a team from finance (sorry finance teams, just an example), I usually will politely ask if anyone has any experience with a particular program before using it. This helps me to understand what I need to bring to the table to get the most out of a meeting. Throwing around terms that others don't understand doesn't make you any more smart, it can sometimes confuse others and typically leads to more meetings. Taking a few extra minutes to put things into language that your listeners can understand can save from communication break downs later down the road.

## If You're Not Comfortable With Your Slide - Delete It

Nothing is more embarrassing than presenting data to an executive and having them say "Well what does this really mean?" and not having an answer. Good or bad, you should always know what you are showing before flashing fancy pie chart or data from Google Analytics. I've found much more success on leaving a slide out and if a question is asked about a topic you aren't sure of, politely letting your executive know that it's something you'll follow up on as soon as possible. Not knowing the answer to data is not only embarrassing, but it often has a lingering effect that their experts don't know how to read the data or that it might not be correct. Make sure you are confident in what you are showing and that you know where you grabbed it from.

## Not All Data Is Necessary data

We live in a time where we can track just about everything. Relating to earlier points, I quickly grow fascinated with tracking everything which can lead me down the hole of no return. Most teams in businesses have a set of key-performance indicators (KPI's) that are driving decisions in the business. Understanding your role in how you affect those KPIs is an important component of reporting up. Make sure when reporting out to a higher up, you always have the KPIs in mind and pull data that is relevant to KPI you are tasked with pulling. If your Marketing leader wants to know how many people have come to the site through monetized ads, don't bore him or her with data that isn't relevant. When in doubt, use KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) on when going back over your slide. If you feel like it's too complex, imagine how the people you are presenting to will feel.

## Conclusion

We have to report up every day, and in a world where data flows in from all directions, finding the stuff that matters to you and your executives can be difficult. Remember, not will understand what you do or how you find your data, and it's on you to relay the information to your audience in the best way possible.
