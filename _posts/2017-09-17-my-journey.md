title: From Code, to English, and Back
---
Being 18 and a freshmen in college does not seem like it was long ago, but it was, and seeing how far I've come on my journey to become a developer has been challenging and bumpy, but most of all fully satisfying. For anyone who thinks that they may be too old or too far along into another career to follow a passion you may have, I urge you to take the plunge and turn your passion into a reality.

I have a vivid memory of sitting in front of my computer, frustrated, trying to get "Hello World!" to appear on my screen as my friends went to parties, dinners, and traveled to other campuses. The 18 year old me couldn't take it. I loved computers so much, but couldn't stand being locked away while others were out having fun. Instead of sticking it out, instead of pushing through, I dropped my Computer Science major and went on undecided for the next semester. The following year, I became an English major, as I loved to read and write as well, and the projects were much less demanding. With the extra time I had, I was finally able to embrace the "college experience."

After a few stints in retail, I started a career with a growing company in their Marketing department. It was here that I was reintroduced to basic web development languages (HTML/CSS) and how to slightly manipulate them to build out basic email templates. The more that I fumbled through code, the more I wondered "what if?" What if I had gotten that CS degree? What if I was an expert at this?

Let me repeat one of my biggest takeaways from questioning myself. *It is NEVER too late to try and learn something new.* It didn't matter that I had chosen a different path years before. I had an opportunity now to revisit and relearn something I was passionate about. After some time of researching ways to learn, I chose the Bloc part time web developer curriculum due to it's flexibility and 1 on 1 mentorship. Again, I had a feeling of excitement and anxiousness, similar to when my parents dropped me off at campus for the first time. This was a new adventure filled with new challenges.

I can happily say that in two months, I can comfortably read code, assess problems, and troubleshoot bugs. I have a supportive mentor who challenges and pushes me to exhaust my options while guiding me to the correct answer. I am looking forward to learning more and more as I continue through the program and hope to continue my journey to become a web developer.

Coding came full circle for me, and I am glad that it did.
