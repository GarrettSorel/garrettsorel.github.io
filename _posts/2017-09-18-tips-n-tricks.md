title: Take a Chill Pill - 5 Tips for Learning Code
---
Learning how to code is difficult. I can think of few things more frustrating than seeing an error or an "undefined" value when you've been working for countless hours trying to get it right and get it working. If you're anything like me, being competitive and swearing it must be the interpreter and not the code, than check out these five tips that have helped me progress over the last few months.

## Check Tags, Variables, etc.

I know, this one is common sense, but when it comes down to it a lot of errors are the result of misspelled variables, missing closing tags, or a forgotten curly bracket. Most modern text editors can assist you with this (Eclipse, Atom, and Microsoft Visual Studio to name a few), but going back through with your own eye is the best way to assess and resolve these errors. I like to use the text editors Find function (CTRL+F if you're a Windows user) and toss my JS variables in to make sure I didn't accidently mess up my camel case or misspell something.

## Take a Quick Break

In my short two months, I've spent quite a few hours banging my head against the wall trying to figure something out. Often times I will get up for dinner, take a walk around the lake, or fold some laundry when the answer suddenly hits me. There is certainly nothing wrong with plowing through hours of frustration, but sometimes you just need to remove yourself from the situation. If I'm planning to code for a few hours, I try and pepper in a few 5-10 minute breaks just to move around and make sure I'm not getting too frustrated. It's easy to regress or end up making more mistakes if you are starting to get flustered. Cooler heads always prevail!

## Coding While Tired is Hard

Learning how to code is a difficult journey. Coding while tired can be downright impossible. A lot like going to the gym, find a time when you are most motivated and most clear headed. I tend to be more of a night owl (and a very cranky morning person), so I like to get home from work and get right to into my assignments. If you feel most productive in the morning, try setting aside a few hours to code while you have your coffee and prepare for the day. Being groggy and tired typically leads to more mistakes, more frustration, and an overall tougher time.

## The Internet is Your Friend (Sometimes)

Let's face it, we all use Google from time to time to solve life's problems. I've even replaced a sink from reading a tutorial I found, and I can reassure you that I am not that handy. Someone has definitely been stuck on the same problem that you are currently stuck on, has asked someone on the internet, and has had their problem resolved. If you've never coded before and are interested in learning, I advise you to get used to snooping around Stack Overflow as you will likely be a frequent visitor. Often times threads will have multiple answers to your questions, which can help you pick up on some tricks and techniques you might not be familiar with.

I will say, struggling through a problem is part of the learning experience. Going to Stack Overflow and hacking together pieces of someone else's code probably won't help you learn as much. As a general rule of thumb, if you spend more than a half hour banging your head against the wall, it's time to do some research.

## Reinforce with Coding Sites

Even though I'm currently enrolled in Bloc, I often venture off into other sites if I feel like I need some extra practice. There are some great tutorials floating around that can help you out tremendously. For tutorial based practice while using a guide, I have really enjoyed reinforcing with Codecademy.com. It can be a bit dry, but it's free classes are great if you're looking to really wrap your head around a something you aren't comfortable with. For those looking for some extra challenges, Codewars.com is a fun way to push the limits of your learnings. Code Wars gives the user challenges to solve using a language you choose, and you can level up and even submit your own challenges. I wouldn't recommend jumping into Code Wars until you feel pretty comfortable in a language, but it can be really fun.

## Conclusion

All in all, coding is not something to take lightly. It takes time and dedication to get to yourself up to speed and requires you to constantly stay on your toes with updates and changes in technology. The key here is you can do it! Remember some of the tips from above and you will get to where you want to be!
